What I did

I made a simple dashboard using Power BI from the Superstore sales dataset. I am still learning visualization, so I tried to show important business points clearly — total sales, profit, sales by category and region, top products, and profit by sub-category.

Tools

Power BI Desktop

Excel (for quick checking)

Superstore.csv dataset

Steps I followed

Imported Superstore.csv into Power BI.

Created KPI cards for Total Sales and Total Profit.

Made charts: Sales by Category, Sales by Region, Top 10 Products (by sales), Profit by Sub-Category.

Added a small text box with key insights and exported the whole report to PDF.

Key insights (beginner summary)

Technology category has high sales.

West and East regions contribute most of revenue.

A few products give most of sales (Top 10).

Some sub-categories show low or negative profit — these need attention.
